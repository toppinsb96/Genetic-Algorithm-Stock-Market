  The project tasked Computer Scientists to create an algorithm to find a single rule to be
used in the stock market. The rule is calculated from a genetic algorithm approach and
the rule is considered the individual during the process. The rules are created and
evaluated over a daily time span. For the genetic algorithm, I used .csv ranging from
1980 to 2018. This allowed me to experiment with a wide variety of dates until I finished
creating the genetic algorithm. The experiment part required 30 historical pieces for
comparison against the rule generated from the genetic algorithm. I chose to limit this
timespan from 2005 to 2018, so that more companies were available for comparison.
Keeping companies consistent in time across the 30 historical pieces is important,
because stock market changes can affect all the companies in similar or widely different
ways. So, keeping a constant in place was important.
The project created strict parameters for the programming of the genetic algorithm. The
genetic algorithm followed a sequence of generating 200 individuals and having an
initial population of 20. The 20 was created using Javaâ€™s random number
generator(RNG), as well as all probabilities and chance decisions in the actual algorithm
use the same RNG. The Java RNG is not perfect, but it allowed for enough randomness
to create an environment to run the genetic algorithm in. Aspects of the process like the
luck variable for crossover and the chance of mutation were set in the project
description.
The project is comprised of two major portions. Generating a rule and then testing that
rule. The generating a rule is done in the genetic algorithm and the testing is done
during the experiment.



Genetic Algorithm:
  The genetic algorithm is comprised of five java files. The java files are: Main.java,
CSVReader.java, Individual.java, Company.java, and Genetic.java.
The Main file only calls the genetic algorithm to start by creating the object and passing
in five .csv files with historical data and then calling a function call startTrading().
CSVReader.java is a generic .csv reading class. It uses a scanner to read a path of a
file and then appends that data to a data ArrayList. Since, the only two pieces of data
needed for calculating the rules is closing price and data, two functions for getting an
ArrayList of closing prices and dates was made.
  Individual.java houses all the information for a single individual in the population. The
class holds the information for what the actual rule is and the fitness of the rule. The
class is also setup to calculate a buy or sell situation. So, the class will evaluate the rule
and return whether or not, on a given day and closing price, if the individual should buy
or sell. Buying and selling is set up as booleans in the class and if the function
checkBuy() evaluates to true, then a buy call is sent, else a sell call is sent.
The Company.java class houses the information for the company and I also chose to
house the money spent and gained in this class. So the company file instantiates two
accounts of money. One account is the money pool which always has $20,000 or less in
it, while there is also a gained account which stores any extra money made over the
initial 20,000. Everytime a stock is bought, a stock counter goes up and for consistency
only one stock a day is bought. The class handles all the actual transactions based
upon the call from the Individual rule calculation and checkBuy() function.
  The Genetic.java is the main file that runs the algorithm utilizing the above classes. The
file starts at a startTrading() function and runs a loop over 200 generations adding to a
running population that is never discarded. The function assigns a fitness to every rule
generated and uses that fitness to create a roulette wheel for selecting parent rules to
generate new child rules for the population. There is a luck variable created to have the
chance of crossover not happening. This variable simulates a new roulette wheel spin
and creates a wider sample space for the population to be generated from. Inside the
crossover section. Crossover happens twice and a chance of mutation happens once
each for the two children generated. After the crossover and mutation both children are
added to the population and fitness is re-evaluated as well as a new roulette wheel. The
generation is only incremented if crossover happened.

  Once the genetic algorithm starts running, the process takes some time to learn the
optimal rule. Brute forcing the coding for the genetic algorithm yields large runtime and
space as each iteration the fitness function is called once or twice and the fitness
always runs through the entire population across a two year time span. I set the start
date to November 21, 1984 and the end date to October 14, 1987. The start date is
exactly 999 days after the February 14, 1980 and the end date is 730 days after the
start date. The inconsistency in an exact two year difference between the dates is
because of the days the stock market is closed across a two year span. This time span
is used across all five companies imported into the genetic algorithm and for each rule.
Fitness is calculated based off earnings or loss during the rules runtime across the two
year span. During the active period of when the rule is being evaluated, each day a buy
or sell call is made. If neither a buy or sell is made a penalty is calculated. The penalty
is halving the current money amount. This penalty does not exist in the experiment
portion. The penalty is only in place to help the genetic algorithm find an optimal rule
that will definitely make money and not converge to a rule that never loses money or
gain money because it never buys or sells. Earnings made pass the initial $20,000
money pool is added to a gain account. At the end of the process all gains and money is
summed up to create a fitness value for the rule. Rules that make money will have a
higher fitness than rules that loss money or made less money. So the rules with the
highest fitness will always be the rules that made the most money.
The roulette is calculated by summing all the fitness values in the population of rules
and dividing each fitness by that sum. The selection uses this percentage to give
individuals with high fitness a better chance of being selected than individuals with low
fitness. The selected individuals are then assigned to a pseudo male and female
variable for the crossover section.
  The crossover section an 80% chance of happening each iteration. The 80% is
hard-coded into the genetic algorithm process and allows for a chance for multiple
roulette wheel spins to happen before creating new children. The children then also
have a a 0.001 chance of mutation, which changes one character inside the rule to a
random character of similar meaning. The crossover section ends with another fitness
evaluation and roulette wheel. If crossover happens then the generation counter is
incremented by 1.
  After the crossover section, the genetic algorithm states what generation it is on and the
current most fit rule before starting the next iteration.
